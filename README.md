In case you are poor enough to repair your laptop keyboard, then follow this repo.
A lightweight, background utility for Windows that blocks specific keyboard keys.

The application runs silently in the system tray and is configured via a simple text file on your desktop.FeaturesSystem Tray Icon: Runs discreetly in the system tray.Dynamic Configuration: Specify which keys to block by editing a simple .cfg file. No need to recompile.Reload on the Fly: Right-click the tray icon to reload your configuration without restarting the application.Toggle Blocking: Easily enable or disable the key blocking functionality from the tray menu.About Dialog: Quickly see which keys are currently being blocked.Lightweight: Uses minimal system resources.Single Instance: Prevents multiple copies of the application from running.How It WorksThe application uses a low-level Windows keyboard hook (WH_KEYBOARD_LL) to intercept keystrokes before they are processed by other applications. It checks each keypress against a user-defined list and blocks it if it finds a match.Installation & UsageDownload: Go to the Releases page of this repository and download the latest main.exe file.Run: Double-click main.exe to start the application. You will see a confirmation message and a new icon will appear in your system tray.Configure: The application will automatically create a configuration file named Nader.cfg on your Desktop.
